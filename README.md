# VMTShader2VertexLitGeneric

Converts 'LightMappedGeneric', 'UnLitGeneric' and 'WorldVertexTransition' Source Engine shaders to VertexLitGeneric in VMT files.

Meant for converting world brush materials to ones that will work on models using the Material Tool in Garry's Mod, but feel free to use it for anything else if you find a use for it.

Instructions: Simply run the script with Python inside the folder containing the unconverted materials. The script will edit the files directly, so be sure to use copies.

The script will log whether it made any change inside each VMT and will print the amount of changed files at the end.
